/*
 * In Java, a package is a way to group related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages together. 
 * It helps in organizing code, avoiding name conflicts, and providing access protection. 
 * Java has two types of packages: 
 * 1. Built-in packages (like java.util, java.io, java.sql) 
 * 2. User-defined packages (created by programmers).
 * 
 * Syntax to define a package: 
 * package packageName;
 * 
 * Example: 
 * package mypackage;
 * public class MyClass {
 *     // code
 * }
